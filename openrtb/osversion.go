// OsVersion type is used for representing OS versions and comparing them. The version considers
// only numeric parts to be valid and takes the generic semver like format of
// MAJOR.MINOR.[BUILD.]PATCH<any-trailing-parts>. It supports an optional build part which is
// considered insignificant. For instance unofficial releases containing "alpha", "beta", "rc".
// Therefore, "1.1.2" and "1.1.2rc" are considered the same. Also, each part, separated by the '.'
// character, is optional; the significance is compared sequentially at its 0th index of the
// version string. Empty version string, or version string that does not start in numeric
// characters are considered as version 0.
